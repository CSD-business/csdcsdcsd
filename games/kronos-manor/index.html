        <h2>About the Game</h2>
        <p>
            Kronos Manor was created as a nine person team. I was the lead programmer.
            It is a point and click adventure game based around the theme of "Time", where each room in this game represents its own time period.
            My core responsibility in this project was to add functionality to the ideas our team (mostly consisting of writers) came up with.
            I'm quite proud of the interaction system in this game.
        </p>
