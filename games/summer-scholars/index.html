        <h2>About the Game</h2>
        <p>
            Summer Scholars was created under the University of Delaware's Summer Scholars program.
            I used this time for research on Technical Art, focusing on rigging, shaders, and workflows.
            I also kept a very well detailed log of documentation of my inspirations, references, as well as difficulties throughout the whole process.
            You can access my documentation right <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gPWc61tL6hsgLDvxBHEs_NMM6bN0BFH1WiF5yHgChz4/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.nkgve93fqh40" class="link">here</a><a>.</a>

        <h2><a href="https://csdcsdcsd.itch.io/summer-scholars">Play the Game</a> - It's on itch because the size is relatively larger than my other games.</h2>

            <li>Aside from terrain textures, I made everything in it!</li>
            <li>This includes meshing, texturing, rigging, and programming the main character.</li>
