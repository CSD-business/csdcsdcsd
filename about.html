        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
            Game Developer from Delaware. I like to make all sorts of games and work either solo or with rather large teams.
            I graduate from the University of Delaware with a degree in Game Studies & Esports in Spring 2026.
            I'm a generalist in most solo work, but I do specialize in 3D art as a Technical Artist on larger teams.
            In development, I don't have too many preferences when it comes to 2D, 3D, art style, game engine or whatever,
            though I do prefer Godot in many circumstances to Unity, which I am also experienced in.
            I am also currently working for Dark Tonic on their game Blunderbusted, a gallery-shooter roguelike, as a technical artist.
        </p>

        <p>
            On my portfolio are my games, many of which were group work for University classes, game jams, or other sponsored projects.
            I believe these reflect my best work, but I also have other projects on my itch.io page.
        </p>
